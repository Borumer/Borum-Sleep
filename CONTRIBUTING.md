# Contributing Guide

This guide is intended for developers of Borum Sleep, people who want to contribute to the Borum Sleep codebase, or people who want to install from source and make local changes to their copy of Borum Sleep.

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome. I track issues on GitHub.
